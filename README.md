CSCI 455 -- Introduction to Programming Systems Design   Spring   2019

This course covers programming in Java and C++. Topics include review of basic
programming concepts such as control structures, functions, and arrays; coverage of more
advanced programming topics such as classes, recursion, inheritance, and linked lists; use
of a container class library to program with tools such as a map class and a sort function;
and an introduction to algorithm analysis. There will also be an emphasis on good
development techniques such as good code style and documentation, unit testing and use
of debugging tools. A second goal of the course is to introduce the Linux programming
environment, including tools such as the shell, simple shell scripts, and makefiles.

Prerequisite: minimal programming experience in some high-level language (can program
with loops, if statements, and call and write functions with parameters)
